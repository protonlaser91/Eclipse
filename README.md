### Eclipse

A battle bot that relies on a database. Clans have been added! 

## Version 0.3 alpha build
Clans have been mostly polished up. A few bugs still exist, but overall it seems to be working fine.

## New fight changes outlined
The fight.ts script will be changed heavily, reducing the need for homogenous troop warfare and mixing it up. The update will subsequently be called "Mixing it up". 

# Any other news will be put here
