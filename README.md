# Eclipse
A battle bot that relies on a database. Clans have been added! 

## Version 0.3 alpha build
Clans have been mostly polished up. A few bugs still exist, but overall it seems to be working fine.

## New fight changes outlined
The fight.ts script will be changed heavily, reducing the need for homogenous troop warfare and mixing it up. The update will subsequently be called "Mixing it up". 

## Needed dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-x64.msi) Node is required to run this program, as it uses discord.js which is a Node.js framework.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) The src folder relies greatly on the added capabilities of TypeScript, and it is a must have to run this bot. (`npm install typescript -g`)

### First time setup
- Run a build method to using the tsconfig.json file as a model. In Visual Studio Code, it is *Ctrl + Shift + B*.
- In the terminal, change the working directory to "../dist" (Usually cd dist) and then initialize the Node.js connection with *node .*
- The program should be up and running and you should see "This bot is online!" in the terminal window.

### Any other news will be put here
